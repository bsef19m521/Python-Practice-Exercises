    "#### Answer.\n",
    "Decision Trees handle continuous features by converting these continuous features to a threshold-based boolean feature. To decide The threshold value, we use the concept of Information Gain, choosing that threshold that maximizes the information gain."

    "Arrays in python can only contain elements of same data types i.e., data type of array should be homogeneous. It is a thin wrapper around C language arrays and consumes far less memory than lists.\n",
    "Lists in python can contain elements of different data types i.e., data type of lists can be heterogeneous. It has the disadvantage of consuming large memory."

    "Correlation measures the relationship between two variables, range from -1 to 1. Causation is when a first event appears to have caused a second event. Causation essentially looks at direct relationships while correlation can look at both direct and indirect relationships.\n",
